<img src="images/jazz.png" alt="population">
<p>Held each year at the end of February this excellent music festival attracts thousands of music fans from around the globe. Hosted at Rios’s Media City the event runs for three days and visitors can enjoy some fantastic performances from some big names from the jazz world. There’s also many other artists and bands performing that aren’t strictly jazz but the line up each year is impressive. http://riojazzfest.com/</p>
<h2>Rio International Boat Show</h2>
<img src="images/boat.png" alt="population">
<p>Even for those who don’t exercise their sea-legs too often, this is an impressive event that is unlike anything else. Visitors can marvel at some of the most jaw-dropping yachts that come from all over the world, and rub shoulders with boat owners, sales companies, skippers and crew as they gather to mingle and network. The event runs for five days at the end of February or early March and attracts around 30,000 people. Unlike many other boat shows events here don’t get started until the afternoon and after the hot desert temperatures have dropped a little, and then the fun goes on into the night with pop-up events, cocktail parties and DJ sets. https://www.boatshowrio.com/</p>
<h2>Swim around </h2>
<img src="images/swim.png" alt="population">
<p>If the thought of booking a room in rios’s most iconic hotel has your wallet screaming in horror then why not try a totally different approach to get up close? The sail-shaped architectural masterpiece stands on an island 280 metres offshore and is accessible to guests via a private bridge. Each year in March hosts a swimming event and as many as 700 participants take the plunge and swim around the island. The race is a total distance of 1,600 metres and there’s also an 800 metre category too. This fun event is growing each year and raises money for local charities. https://globalswimseries.com/al-arab-swim/</p>
<h2>Taste of Rio</h2>
<img src="images/taste.png" alt="population">
<p>One of the best things about travelling to new places must surely be sampling the cuisine. This event may be rios’s unofficial food festival but it still attracts visitors from around the world since it first took place back in 2007. Attendees can enjoy live cooking demonstrations by celebrity chefs and some of the top local restaurants offer their most popular dishes for a smidgen of the cost that diners pay in-house. Taste of  takes place in March and is one of the most popular annual festivals. http://tasteofdubaifestival.com/</p>

<img src="images/cup.png" alt="population">
<p>Held each March at the Meydan Racecourse, this horse racing event has some serious prize money up for grabs, to the tune of a staggering 12 million US dollars. Locals and tourists flock to state of the art venue to see the skilled jockeys, trainers, millionaire owners and, of course, some of the world’s finest race horses galloping to the finish line - and hopefully bringing some winnings their way. http://www.dubairacingclub.com/</p>

<img src="images/surprise.png" alt="population">
<p>If you can keep your cool in temperatures of around 40C then July is a great time to visit RIO.

But this month long event might just do the trick, as many of the events take place in the delightfully cool shopping malls. There’s competitions, family fun, creative workshops, discounted restaurants and shopping to be enjoyed. www.visitrio.com</p>

<p>In a location that is renowned for being an excellent shopping experience, it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise to learn that there is a festival dedicated to it.
